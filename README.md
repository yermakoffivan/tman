# tman — supervise runaway test processes from AI coding agents

**Runaway tests, meet the reaper.** A single NativeAOT binary that supervises every process it launches — killing runs that have genuinely hung, capping time, memory, and CPU when you ask it to, and automatically reaping the orphans your LLM agents leave behind when they hang, get distracted, or your machine suspends.

## Why

LLM agents start test suites and then hang, get distracted, or survive a machine suspend — leaving processes that drain your system for hours. `tman` wraps every run with hard limits and a reaper, so nothing outlives its welcome.

- **wall-time + stall kills** — `--max-time 10m`, `--stall 30m` (on Linux: silent *and* idle = hung, so quiet-but-busy work like `go test` keeps running)
- **resource culling** — opt-in `--max-mem 2g`, `--max-cpu 95` (sustained) kill the whole process tree; both are measured across the tree on Linux, so a runner that forks its workers cannot hide behind an idle root
- **orphan reaping** — every `tman` command kills children whose runner died and prunes expired records; a lock whose runner died is taken over in place by the next run of that name
- **dedup locks** — `--name test` refuses duplicates; `--replace` kills the old run and waits for it to hand the name back
- **resource gating** — `--max-parallel 2` queues excess runs instead of stampeding cores
- **failure logs** — every supervised run leaves `.tman/<alias>.log`, and a failed one leaves `.tman/<alias>.fail.log` with the failure lines extracted; both are cleared at the start of the next run
- **per-project scoping** — locks and slots bucket by name (or command) *and* directory, so one repo's runs never block another's
- **folder aliases** — `.tman.kdl` per project, with repo-root shims so `./test` is supervised transparently
- **~3.8 MB native binary**, zero runtime deps, cross-platform (linux/mac/windows, x64/arm64)

## Install

**npm**
```sh
npm install -g @standardbeagle/tman
```

**shell one-liner**
```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/standardbeagle/tman/main/install.sh | sh
```

**from source** — requires the [.NET 10 SDK](https://dot.net):
```sh
git clone https://github.com/standardbeagle/tman
cd tman
dotnet publish -c Release -r linux-x64   # or win-x64, osx-arm64, linux-arm64
cp bin/Release/net10.0/*/publish/tman ~/.local/bin/
```

Prebuilt binaries are attached to every [GitHub release](https://github.com/standardbeagle/tman/releases) for linux-x64, linux-arm64, win-x64, osx-arm64, and osx-x64.

## Quick start

```sh
# supervise anything
tman run --max-time 10m --max-mem 2g -- npm test

# adopt in a project (auto-detects npm / pytest / go / make)
cd your-project
tman init --shims --gitignore
./test        # now supervised: stall backstop, dedup + parallel gating
```

## Commands

| command | what it does |
| --- | --- |
| `tman run [flags] -- <cmd> [args]` | run a process under supervision |
| `tman run --alias <name> [args]` / `tman <alias>` | run a `.tman.kdl` alias |
| `tman list [--all]` | list live runs (or all records) |
| `tman kill <id\|name\|all>` | kill run(s); an unknown flag refuses the command with exit 127 rather than being skipped; exits 1 when part of a run's tree could not be killed |
| `tman clean` | run the housekeeping sweep now and report what it did |
| `tman status [id\|name\|id-prefix] [--json]` | summary counts, or one run's detail |
| `tman init [--shims] [--gitignore]` | scaffold `.tman.kdl` + shims (aliases it cannot detect are left commented out, so `./test` fails loudly instead of faking a pass); `--gitignore` ignores `.tman/` and the shims, and skips an alias whose name is already a directory, so `/test` never hides a `test/` tree |
| `tman hook pretooluse` | [Claude Code hook](#claude-code-hook): routes bare test/build commands through tman, and never blocks |

## Run flags

| flag | default | what it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--name N` | — | dedup lock; refuses if a live run has the same name **in this directory** |
| `--replace` | off | with `--name`: kill the existing run, then wait for its runner to release the name (up to `--queue-timeout`); refuses to start if it is still held |
| `--max-time T` | — | wall-clock limit → kill, exit 124 |
| `--stall T` | 30m | no output **and** no cpu/io/kernel-io-wait activity for T → kill, exit 125 |
| `--max-mem M` | — | ceiling on the process tree's RSS (MB or `2g`) → cull, exit 126 |
| `--max-cpu P` | — | process-tree CPU above P% for 3 consecutive 1s ticks → cull, exit 126 |
| `--max-parallel N` | 2 | queue until one of the bucket's N slots can be held; a run that has to wait says so once on stderr (with the queue timeout) and once more, `slot acquired after Xs`, when it gets through |
| `--queue-timeout T` | 5m | give up waiting for a slot |

Cap precedence: CLI flags > alias block > `defaults` block > built-ins.

A cap flag whose value cannot be read refuses the run with exit 127 and names the flag —
`bad --max-cpu`, `bad --max-parallel` — nothing is clamped or defaulted. `--max-cpu` takes a
non-negative number and `--max-parallel` a non-negative integer.

#### Which waits `--stall` protects

On Linux a tick counts as activity if the tree's CPU jiffies moved, its `rchar`/`wchar` moved, or
any process in it sits in state `D` (uninterruptible sleep — the kernel is servicing an io request).
So:

| The run is… | Protected? | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| burning CPU silently (`go build`, a compile) | yes | cpu jiffies advance |
| reading/writing files silently | yes | `rchar`/`wchar` advance |
| blocked on disk or NFS io | yes — see the caveat below | state `D` |
| streaming over a socket, even slowly | yes | socket bytes move `rchar`/`wchar` |
| **waiting on a peer that has sent nothing yet** | **no** | zero bytes, zero CPU, and it parks in `S` — indistinguishable from `sleep 3600` |
| genuinely idle or hung | no — killed, as intended | same signals, correctly absent |

**The `D` row is level-triggered, and that has a cost.** CPU and io count only when they *move*
between ticks; `D` counts whenever it is merely *present*. A process wedged permanently in `D` — a
dead NFS server, a failing disk — therefore looks alive to `--stall` on every tick forever. That is
a real hang that `--stall` will never kill, and `--max-time` is the only thing that bounds it. If
you touch network filesystems, do not run with `--stall` as your sole backstop.

The last two rows are the same signal, which is why the honest answer is a *wide* `--stall`: at the
`30m` default a slow API, a long DB query, a lock wait or a long-poll has to be silent for half an
hour before it trips. **If an alias legitimately waits on a network peer, do not tighten `--stall`
to bound it — that is `--max-time`'s job.** `--stall` asks "is this dead?"; `--max-time` asks "has
this taken too long?", and only the second can bound a wait that looks identical to a hang.

Two Linux-only caveats. State `D` is read from `/proc`, so on macOS and Windows the disk/NFS row
falls back to output-only detection like everything else. And WSL2 under-reports socket bytes in
`/proc/<pid>/io` by roughly 5000x (6MB received moved `rchar` by 1187 bytes), so the streaming-socket
row still holds there but with far less margin — a run trickling a few bytes a minute can round to
no observable delta. File io accounting is exact on WSL2.

### Buckets

Dedup locks and parallel slots are scoped per **bucket**, not machine-wide. A bucket is
`<name>@<dir>` for a named run and `<command>@<dir>` for an unnamed one, where `<dir>` is the
`.tman.kdl` directory governing the run (or the cwd when there is none):

```
/repo-a  tman test          -> bucket  test@/repo-a
/repo-b  tman test          -> bucket  test@/repo-b   # independent: does not queue behind repo-a
/repo-a  tman run -- vite   -> bucket  vite@/repo-a   # independent of test@/repo-a
```

So `max-parallel 2` means *two of this thing here*, and a long test run in one checkout never
starves a build in another.

A run is admitted by **holding** one of its bucket's slot files open exclusively — not by counting
the live runs in the bucket. Only one runner can hold a given slot file, so runs launched at the
same instant queue as configured; counting could not offer that, because every racer reads the
count before any of them has a record to be counted. A slot is given up when the handle closes,
which includes the runner dying and the kernel closing it. A run that is already inside a
supervised tree (`TMAN_RUN_ID` set) is the same work as its parent and claims no slot of its own.

## .tman.kdl

Resolved from the current directory upward, like `.git`. An alias (`tman test`, `tman run --alias
test`) runs in the directory holding that `.tman.kdl`, so its args can be written relative to the
config and the record's cwd is the config's directory. A bare `tman run -- cmd` runs where you
are standing.

```kdl
defaults {
    stall "30m"       // hang backstop, not a runtime budget — see --stall above
    max-parallel 2
    retain "24h"      // how long finished run records are kept
    // opt-in ceilings — a build is supposed to saturate cores and can want several GB
    // max-mem 8192      // MB, summed across the process tree
    // max-cpu 95        // percent, sustained, summed across the process tree
}

alias "test" {
    command "npm"
    args "run" "test"
}

alias "e2e" {
    command "pytest"
    args "tests/e2e" "--tb=short"
    max-time "30m"
    max-mem 4096
}
```

The parser reads a subset of KDL: nodes with string and number arguments, `//` and `/* */`
comments, and `/-` slashdash, which comments out the next node or value. Properties
(`max-parallel=4`) are refused with a message naming the `max-parallel 4` form to write instead.

## Run logs

Every run governed by a `.tman.kdl` writes its combined stdout and stderr to `.tman/<alias>.log`
next to that config, and a run that does **not pass** also writes `.tman/<alias>.fail.log` — a
digest carrying the outcome, the command, and every failure line in the log with the lines that
followed it, plus the tail. tman prints the digest path on stderr when it writes one.

```
$ ./test
...
tman: failures logged to /home/you/project/.tman/test.fail.log

$ cat .tman/test.fail.log
tman failure digest — test
  outcome:  exit 1
  command:  /usr/bin/python3 -m pytest -q
  cwd:      /home/you/project
  started:  2026-08-23 16:30:40Z  (2.1s)
  full log: /home/you/project/.tman/test.log

── 3 failure line(s) ──
     7: E   AssertionError: widget count wrong
     8: E   assert 1 == 2
     9:
    10: test_smoke.py:2: AssertionError
    11: =========================== short test summary info ============================
    12: FAILED test_smoke.py::test_fails - AssertionError: widget count wrong
```

The point is the clearing. **Both files are truncated at the start of every run, and the digest is
deleted when a run passes**, so what is on disk always describes the last run of that alias. A
digest that outlived the failure it reported would be worse than none, because it reads exactly
like a real one — the presence of `.tman/*.fail.log` *is* the signal that something is broken now.

That is what makes it useful to an agent: it can answer "which test failed" by reading a path it
can name, without re-running the suite, and long after the console output it came from is gone.

Failure lines are matched by **shape, not by runner** — `FAILED …`, `--- FAIL:`, `[FAIL]`,
`Failed!`, `panic:`, `not ok`, `: error …`, `×`, `●`, and friends. A runner whose output nothing
matches degrades to "no failure lines matched" plus the tail, never to an empty file that reads
like a clean run.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| location | `.tman/` beside the governing `.tman.kdl`; `tman init --gitignore` ignores it |
| three files per **alias**, not per run | `<alias>.log`, `<alias>.fail.log`, and `<alias>.lock`, so the path is nameable without looking a run id up first. The `.lock` is what keeps two runs from writing one log: a named run is already alone by its name lock, but `max-parallel 2` admits two unnamed `tman run -- npm test` at once, so each run claims the lock while it writes. The second claimant gets no log and says so — `tman: .tman/npm.log is held by a concurrent run; this run's output is not captured`. The lock file is never removed, for the same reason as the store's locks below |
| nested runs | a run inside a supervised tree (`TMAN_RUN_ID` set) opens no log, as it claims no slot: its parent is already capturing the same output, and a second file under another name is the one an agent reads by mistake |
| no `.tman.kdl` | no log — an unconfigured `tman run` has no project to write into, and `.tman/` dirs scattered through arbitrary cwds is not a side effect a supervisor should have |
| size | the full log is capped at 64 MB, after which the most recent 512 KB is kept and the cut is marked |
| killed runs | get a digest too: the outcome line names the kill reason, and the tail is the last output before the silence |

## AI agent setup

Which mechanism you get depends on one property of your agent: whether its pre-tool hook can
**replace** a shell command, or only allow and deny it. There is a guide per agent, each with the
exact config, a runnable adapter where one is needed, and a smoke test:

| agent | integration | hook event | guide |

Per-command caps — what `--stall` should be for a cold Rust build, why a dev server must never get
a `--max-time` — are in the [tuning guides](https://dev.standardbeagle.com/tman/tuning/), one page
per test, lint, and build tool.

### Claude Code hook

Shims only catch commands that go through a shell lookup, on a machine where `tman init --shims`
ran. An agent calling a Bash tool with `npm test` walks straight past them. `tman hook pretooluse`
is the same policy applied one level up — it reads the tool call on stdin and re-issues bare test
and build commands through `tman`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      { "matcher": "Bash", "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "tman hook pretooluse" }] }
    ]
  }
}
```

| the agent runs | what happens |
| --- | --- |
| `go test ./...` in a project with `.tman.kdl` | rewritten to `/path/to/tman run -- go test ./...`, and the rewrite is announced |
| `go test ./...` with no `.tman.kdl` | runs unchanged; the agent is told it was unsupervised |
| `tman test`, or anything inside a supervised tree (`TMAN_RUN_ID` set) | untouched — no double supervision |
| `cd app && npm test`, `CI=1 npm test` | runs unchanged, with a note; this hook does not parse shell and will not prefix a string it did not parse |
| `git status`, `npm run dev`, anything else | untouched |
| any of the above, when tman cannot prove which binary it is running as | runs unchanged, with a note naming the path it refused to use |

It supervises exactly what was asked for (`tman run -- <command>`), never the project's alias of
the same name — an alias can point somewhere else, and silently running something other than the
command in the transcript is worse than running it unsupervised.

The rewrite names the **running binary by absolute path**, not `tman`, because the Bash tool
resolves a program name against its own `PATH` — which frequently does not include `~/.local/bin`
or the node bin directory tman installs into.

That path has to be *proven* to be tman before it is emitted: fully qualified, named as tman ships
(`tman` or `tman.exe`), and present on disk. Nothing else counts as proof. Launched as
`dotnet tman.dll` rather than as the `tman` executable, the running process is the shared dotnet
host, and rewriting to it would hand the agent `dotnet run -- go test ./...` — which, in a
directory holding a `.csproj`, builds and launches an unrelated application. So whenever the hook
cannot prove what it is about to name — no path, a bare or relative one, a path that is gone, or
one belonging to some other host — it warns, names the path it rejected, and leaves the command
exactly as written.

**It cannot block you.** A missing binary, a malformed request, an unreadable project: every
failure path leaves the command exactly as written. Exit code 2 is the only one Claude Code treats
as a block, and this hook never returns it — so `tman` being uninstalled costs supervision, never
the build.

## Housekeeping

There is no daemon and no cron entry. Every `tman` command — including `tman list` — performs the
same sweep before it does anything else:

- kills orphans (a live child whose runner died, e.g. after a machine suspend); a record whose
  child had already gone is marked `killed: child exit status unknown`, never as a clean exit
- deletes finished records older than `retain` (default 24h), along with unreadable or
  off-schema record files that nothing else would ever revisit

Lock files are not part of it. A lock is claimed by holding its file open exclusively, so the
kernel releases it when its runner dies and the next run of that bucket takes the same file over
in place. Removing one is never safe while tman is running — a run that opened the name a moment
earlier would take the lock as the sweep dropped it and end up holding a file with no name, while
the next run created a fresh one — so nothing in tman removes them. `~/.tman/runs` keeps one
`.lock` per bucket it has seen for the name dedup, plus one per parallel slot that bucket has ever
handed out.

**The bound, stated plainly:** each is ~50 bytes but occupies one filesystem block, so budget about
4 KB per bucket. A development machine reuses a handful of buckets and settles at a few dozen
kilobytes. The one case that grows without limit is a host whose working directory changes every
build — a CI runner whose workspace path carries a build number — which seeds a new bucket each
time: on the order of 20 MB a year at twenty builds a day. If that is you, `rm ~/.tman/runs/*.lock`
while no runs are live, from the same cleanup step that clears the workspace. tman deliberately
does not do this for you: making it safe against a concurrent claim costs every `tman run` a
store-wide lock, which is a poor trade for reclaiming a few megabytes a year.

`tman clean` runs that sweep on demand and prints the counts. Records are canonical on disk:
absolute resolved command paths, absolute cwd, one nested `Caps` object, and a schema version, so a
record written by a different tman version is discarded rather than half-read.

## Exit codes

| code | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 0–n | child's own exit code |
| 124 | timed out (`--max-time`) |
| 125 | stalled (`--stall`) |
| 126 | culled (`--max-mem` / `--max-cpu`) |
| 127 | command / config not found |
| 130 | killed (dedup refusal, queue timeout, `tman kill`, Ctrl+C, exit status unknown) |

tman never reports 0 for a run it did not see finish. A Ctrl+C interrupts the run as a whole, so a
child that traps the signal and exits 0 on its way out is still reported as 130.

## Scope

tman is built for one machine at a time — a developer's laptop, or a department-sized CI host with
a handful of runners. At that size it does what it says: a rogue test runner does not sit in a loop
on your battery, and a test server does not hold a port for the rest of the afternoon.

It is not a fleet scheduler. There is no cross-machine coordination, no central store, and nothing
here is tuned for dozens of simultaneous runs or for hosts that accumulate work indefinitely. If
you are running an agent farm or a build fleet, you want a job scheduler, and tman under it is
fine — but it will not be the thing keeping that fleet in order.
